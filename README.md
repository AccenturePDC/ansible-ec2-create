## Overview

This playbook uses ec2 modules to create AWS EC2 instances, security group, and attach an extra EBS volume. 

## General Usage

  - Authenticate ansible-playbook to your AWS account
    
	```bash
	export EC2_ACCESS_KEY=Your AWS Account Access Key
	export EC2_SECRET_KEY=Your AWS Account Secret Key
	```
	
  - To provision EC2 instance, run the command:
  
    ```bash
    ansible-playbook provision.yml --extra-vars "instance_name=MY_EC2_INSTANCE aws_region=${AWS_REGION} key_name=${AWS_KEY_PAIR} vpc_subnet_id=${SUBNET} ami_id=${CENTOS_AMI_ID} instance_type=${MASTERS_INSTANCE_TYPE} volume_size=${ROOT_VOLUME_SIZE} lv_volume_size=${LV_VOLUME_SIZE} vpc_id=${AWS_VPC_ID} volume_device_name='/dev/sda1' env=sandbox vpc_cidr_block=${AWS_VPC_CIDR}"
    ```

The playbook will generate a file called instance_ids.txt which contains the instance id of the provisioned EC2. This is intended for the below playbook to be accepted as a parameter and delete the said instance.

  - To delete the instance you just provisioned. Run the following:

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook terminate_instances.yml
    ```
